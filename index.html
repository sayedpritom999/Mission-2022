                <p> <small>Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete
                        assignment that demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be
                        repeated, thus, everyone's task is unique as his specific opportunity to implement it.</small>

                        they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact.
                        It's an opinion. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is
                        nothing.</small> </p>
